# Physical-Therapy-Ecosystem
This is a non IT guys attempt at building a Database/web application to have every Physical therapist provider, company, consultant in one ecosystem. The idea is to make the physical therapy world smaller. This is a one stop shop for data on continuing education, research, chats, provider profiles, company profiles etc. 
I need help with the following: Getting all Licensed Physical Therapists that have an NPI number from NPPES database. This file is huge and it is difficult with taxonomy codes and secondary codes etc. 
I need web scrapers or AI scrapers to find all physical therapy companies in the united states. I then need data on when they were formed, rough estimate of employees, how many locations they have, CEO name, website, private equity backed?, if so, name of PE firm.
I want to pull in real articles and research from external sources.
I want to find all consulting companies in the industry.
